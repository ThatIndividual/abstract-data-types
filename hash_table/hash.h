/* An open adressing hash table. Collisions are solved with Robin Hood hashing.
   Catastrophic linear pileup is averted by setting a threshold on the number
   of linear probes an insertion operation can do before the table needs to be
   resized.

   The table allocates a number of slack rows, that do not factor into its
   declared size. For example, if a table has a size of 32 and a slack of 5,
   the initial insertion operation could only target rows 0 to 31. But, if it
   targets row 31 and finds it is already occupied, it can continue probing
   rows 32 to 36. Coupled with the fact that the threshold on probing is
   precisely the number of slack rows, this means we can skip bounds checking
   when inserting.                                                           */
